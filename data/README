4x examples:

Span of cube (1,1,1):

edgeA.4x.nrrd: [3,4]
edgeB.4x.nrrd: [2.47,3.18]
edgeC.4x.nrrd: [3.5,4.5]
edgeD.4x.nrrd: [2.26,3.39]

cornerA.4x.nrrd: [1,2]
cornerB.4x.nrrd: [1,2]

saddleA.4x.nrrd: [2,3]
saddleB.4x.nrrd: [2.1,3.1]
saddleC.4x.nrrd: [1.7,2.7].  
  Note: Only two gradients represented at corner vertices even though cube
  intersects three different gradient fields.
